# Security baseline

- Tenant context must come from authenticated membership, never from a frontend-supplied organization ID.
- Enforce RBAC server-side.
- Scope every business query by organization.
- Store password hashes only.
- Validate and reject unknown request fields.
- Use PostgreSQL Decimal/NUMERIC for money.
- Audit financial and permission changes.
- Add cross-tenant isolation tests before production.

## Repository-wide audit reconciliation — 2026-09-24

### Release status
This slice is **not, by itself, evidence of full production readiness**. The current repository audit found unfinished frontend integration and infrastructure/documentation inconsistencies outside the individual backend slice.

### Mandatory release blockers relevant to this slice
- Real production UI/API integration must replace any demo or hardcoded business data for this domain.
- Tenant authorization must remain server-side; client organization identifiers are selectors only and never authorization.
- Production storage configuration must use one canonical variable vocabulary; current package/Compose/backup configuration is inconsistent.
- Release documentation and migration references must match the actual repository state.
- Production claims must be limited to functionality that is implemented and validated.

### Verification evidence
Latest SahlBiz CI/CD validation on `main` is green, including authenticated E2E and Prisma migration deployment. Environment-dependent staging, Docker, backup/restore and production checks remain separate release gates.
